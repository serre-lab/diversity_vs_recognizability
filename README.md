# Diversity vs. Recognizability: Human-like generalization in one-shot generative models

## 1. Train the one-shot generative models

### VAE-STN (VAE with spatial transformer [])
```
python train
```

### VAE-NS (Neural Statistician [])
```
python train
```

### DAGAN (Data Augmentation GAN [])
```
python train
```

## 2. Train the critic networks
### SimCLR
```
python train
```

### Protoypical Net
```
python train
```

## 3. Evaluate the one-shot generative models on the Diversity vs. Recognizability framework.
